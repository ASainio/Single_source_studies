<p>Title: "Brightening of EF Eridani Observed by ASAS-SN and WISE/NEOWISE missions"</p>

<p><a href="https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=EF+Eridani" target="_blank">EF Eridani</a> (RA=03:14:13.25, 
DEC= -22:35:42.90) is a cataclysmic binary consisting of a white dwarf and a low-mass companion. 
It was identified as an AM Herculis-type magnetic cataclysmic variable during its bright state in 1979 
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979ApJ...232L..27G/abstract" target="_blank">Griffiths et al. 1979</a>).
In 1997, the system was found in a low state that lasted for 10 years until a new brightening was reported by 
Koji Mukai in 2008 (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ASPC..137..446W/abstract" target="_blank">Wheatley & Ramsay 1998</a>, ATEL #1562).</p>

<p>NASA's WISE mission was launched in September 2009 and continued as the NEOWISE mission from 2013 
(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140.1868W/abstract" target="_blank">Wright et al. 2010</a>, 
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...792...30M" target="_blank">Mainzer et al. 2014</a>). 

The WISE missions collected 360 detections of EF Eri in both W1 (3.4 μm) and W2 (4.6 μm) wavelengths, 
for a total of 720 detections. 
We present the W1 and W2 L1b mean epoch photometry including the last observations from the NEOWISE mission.</p>

<p>The first 21 epochs, from UT 2010-01-22.03 to UT 2022-08-01.40, did not present high-amplitude variability in 
either band.

<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230403791H/abstract" target="_blank">Hart et al. 2023</a>) 
has observed EF Eri since 2012, collecting 5,477 data points so far in V and g bands.

They observed the star in the V band from UT 2012-02-01.34 to UT 2018-11-29.39, resulting in a mean V band magnitude of 16.827 ± 0.177. Observations in the g band began on UT 2017-09-18.38.</p>
On UT 2022-12-02.14, EF Eri exhibited a slightly brighter optical detection (g = 16.857 ± 0.198) compared 
to its previous mean (g =17.179 ± 0.161), and within six days, by UT 2022-12-08.23, 
the system had brightened significantly to g = 14.671 ± 0.057.

<p> Current peak in g band was achieved between UT 2023-02-27.13 and 2023-03-03.01 when 9 consecutive measurements 
averaged ~14.218 ±0.035 magnitudes. 
<a href="https://asas-sn.osu.edu/sky-patrol/coordinate/3b800157-c33e-419c-999c-5d61475daa49" target="_blank">Current ASAS-SN light curve</a> 
does not exhibit other such variability on either band since 2012 when EF Eri was first observed.</p>

ASAS-SN data suggest that, even though the brightening has been steadily fading, the latest measurements 
on UT 2024-12-01.14 still present a mean g = 15.429 ± 0.038, which is >1.7 magnitudes above the mean before its 
current state.


<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>Currently, EF Eri is undergoing a brightening event observed in both mid-infrared and optical wavelengths 
that began in December 2022. EF Eri peaked in the g band by ~2.9 magnitudes, WISE W1 brightened by ~1.7 magnitudes, 
and W2 increased by ~1.5 magnitudes above the previous mean in January 2023. The last epochs from the NEOWISE mission, 
as well as the latest ASAS-SN observations, continue to show significant brightening in all observed wavelengths. 
The optical peak seems to be lowering more rapidly than the MIR brightening, but the current state of all bands 
remains substantially elevated.</p>

<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong></p>
Franz-Josef Hambsch has started UT 2024-05-12 EF Eri to observing program and will be submitting 
photometry to <a href="https://www.aavso.org/data-access" target="_blank">AAVSO photometric archive</a>.
